Grove - IMU 9DOF is a high performance 9-axis motion tracking module,which is base on MPU-9150.The MPU-9150 is the world's first integrated 9-axis motion tracking device designed for the low power, low cost, and high performance requirements of consumer electronics equipment including smartphones, tablets and wearable sensors .MPU-9150 features three 16-bit ADC for digitizing the gyroscope outputs and three 16-bit ADCs for digitizing the accelerometer outputs and three 13-bit ADCs for digitizing the magnetometer outputs.

Specifications:

- I2C interface 
- Low cost 
- 400kHz Fast Mode I2C for communicating with all registers 
- Digital-output X-, Y-, and Z-Axis angular rate sensors (gyroscopes) with a user-programmable full-scale range of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and ±2000°/sec
- Digital-output 3-Axis accelerometer with a programmable full scale range of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g and ±16g
- 3-axis silicon monolithic Hall-effect magnetic sensor with magnetic concentrator
